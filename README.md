## Day 1

Didn't do anything for this project

## Day 2

if/else, questions 1-5

## Day 3

Loops, questions 6 & 7

## Day 4
Pair programming with Rebecca.
Wrapped all of the questions in functions and moved functions to the bottom so they would run in order.
Created and alert using isNaN to prompt non-response users on question 6 to enter a number.
Changed response on question 7 to include all array items.
Chilled!

Final edits and styling
