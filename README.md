## Day 1

Focused on using object-literals to create pages

## Day 2

Built one constructor function with prototype, hopefully can replicate. Webpage is coming along.

## Day 3

Computer issues held up progress but was able to sum hourly totals in a single row at the bottom and allow for new store inputs. Turns out this was done badly, and had to redo my table on Thursday.
